    <h1>History</h1>
    <h2>The Journey</h2>
    <ul class="bullet1">
        <li>Worked in the  healthcare industry in account receivable and revenue cycle management</li>
        <li>Possess a MBA degree with a concentration in Entrepreneurial Studies</li>
        <li>Trained in full stack development</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Throughout my career there has always been some unforeseen challenge, some inevitable response to change that presented itself: a challenge that taxed the systems and processes in place; a challenge that was beyond the scope of the available technology. My response innovate: go outside the conventional, the established to achieve the desired outcome; customize the available technology to address the need.</p>
    
    <h2>The Purpose</h2>
    <p>I volunteer my time and expertise in running a nonprofit that serves the community through entrepreneurship, partnership, and education. It is has been a 12 year labor of love. Here I “cut my teeth” in web.design and development. Simply, because something needed to be done  and  technology presented the most cost effective way to do it. Technology helped us to compete and “do much with little”, while not losing sight of our core values and business objectives. I made the decision to abandon the conventional career path and pursue the thing I love: serving the small business and non-profit communities through the coupling of business acumen and technology. <span><strong>Business is the driver. Technology is the inspiration.</strong></span></p>
    
    <h2>TechHandie is founded on this  principle</h2>
    <p>Understand the business and its vision. Understand the problem or challenge. Develop a  custom web based solution(s).</p>
